Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby\nfoothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to\nprey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the\nRedbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.\nBut you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands.\nSomeone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the\nRedbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You\nescaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good\nfortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with\nonly the tools of your trade to your name.\nPersonal Goal: Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands\nnearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And\nthen you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff,\nmaybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you:\nsomeone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She\nlives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands\nwho still want you dead.\nAlignment: Neutral. You tend to do whatever seems best at the\ntime. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re\nnot personally committed to making the world a better place. But you\nhave no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they\nalready are.",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>",
