      "1. As P is currently prone, the first action should be to stand up. Unfortunately, there is no movement available, but since we have a reaction, we can use it to stand up. The reaction action will not interfere with the bonus action or additional actions in subsequent rounds.\n",
      "2. After standing up, the bonus action can be used to cast a cantrip, such as Guidance, if available, to help an ally in the next round.\n",
      "3. Since the enemy is disengaging, it is best to position ourselves for an advantageous attack in the next round. As we have no movement this round, the best option is to attack with a melee weapon in the next round after moving, assuming the enemy is still within reach.\n",
      "4. In the meantime, it's essential to keep an eye on the enemy's movements and plan our strategy for the next round. If possible, try to maneuver into a better position for an attack of opportunity if the enemy attacks an ally or moves provokingly.\n",
      "5. If the enemy moves out of range, consider using a ranged attack as a backup plan, but keep in mind that P's melee weapon attack may have better odds of hitting and dealing damage, especially if the enemy is moving quickly.\n",
      "6. Finally, if there's an opportunity to heal or regain resources, use a spell slot or other means to do so before the encounter ends, as maintaining health and resources is crucial for survival in combat.\n",

      "Given the current conditions, P (the fighter) is prone and disengaging from E (the rogue). Since P is prone, moving without standing up would provoke an attack of opportunity from E. To avoid this, P should first stand up as a free action, and then move to a more advantageous position.\n",

      "After standing up, P should move 5ft towards E to close the distance. Since P is currently disengaging, moving towards E does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "P does not have any ranged weapons to attack E at this range, and there are no other actions or bonus actions available. Therefore, P cannot attack E with a ranged weapon at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "By moving 5ft and standing up, P can position themselves for a melee attack on their next turn, assuming E does not move or take actions that provoke an attack of opportunity. This move also allows P to potentially gain cover from the barrels in the map, depending on their positioning after moving.\n",

      "3. By disengaging now, I am hoping to force the enemy to reveal their position, which will help my party members if they have line of sight to the enemy's location. This might also allow them to engage the enemy while I continue to regroup and prepare for the next phase of the encounter.\n",

      "As a prone character, your melee attack rolls suffer a disadvantage, which isn't ideal in this situation where the enemy's health is quite low. Instead, you can choose to stand up using a dash action, which allows you to move up to your speed while standing. This action also ends your prone condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "After standing up, you can take a bonus action to make an attack with your melee weapon. At this point, you can move closer to the enemy if necessary, or simply attack from your current position to deal as much damage as possible. After your bonus action, you still have one reaction left, which can be used for defensive purposes if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if you have a ranged weapon available, you can use the 1st action to attack the enemy with it, but keep in mind that this may not be as effective as melee attacks due to the enemy's low health.\n",

However, since Disengaging means I can move out of the enemy's reach without provoking an attack of opportunity, I can move 5ft in a direction that disengages me from the enemy.

      "3. I use my Bonus Action to stand up, as I'm still prone after moving.\n",

      "5. I end my turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm trying to defeat the enemy, I prioritize attacking with Magic Missile. After moving to get out of prone and casting Shield for protection, I use my Bonus Action to stand up. This way, I can optimize my attack action by not being prone, which gives disadvantage on attack rolls.\n",

      "list index out of range\n",
      "unusual response:  2: Move and use Bonus Action to Stand Up\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm currently prone, I need to stand up to have full movement and attack options. I don't have any movement points available, so I'll need to use my Bonus Action to stand up.\n",
      "\n",
      "After standing up, I'll have the following actions and movement available:\n",
      "\n",
      "Available movement: [0]ft\n",
      "Available actions: 1\n",
      "Bonus actions: 0\n",
      "Reactions: 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm a wizard, I'll be using a spell to attack the enemy. Let's say I choose to use a Magic Missile spell, which is a 1st level spell that I have 3 slots for. This spell allows me to make 3 darts of magical force, each dealing 1d4+1 force damage on a hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'll spend one of my remaining 1st level spell slots to cast Magic Missile, and then use my action to make the attack. This will give me a total of 3d4+3 damage that I can potentially deal to the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the attack, if there are any other actions or reactions I need to take, I'll handle those as necessary. If there are no other actions or reactions needed, I'll end my turn.\n",

      "Action: Move (Disengage and Stand Up)\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "As a cleric, movement is a key aspect of your character. You are currently prone and disengaging, so you need to use your movement to stand up and prepare for combat. You have no movement points available, but since you are disengaging, you can move up to your speed (which is 25ft for a cleric) and end your disengage action. After standing up, you can then use your reaction to Dodge to avoid opportunity attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have stood up, you can use your bonus action to Cast a spell. Since you have 3 level 1 spell slots, you can choose from Cure Wounds, Bless, and Guiding Bolt. If the enemy is within 60 feet, you can cast Guiding Bolt at the enemy. If not, you can move closer to the enemy and cast Cure Wounds on yourself to regain some health.\n",
      "\n",
      "After taking these actions, you can then use your action to attack the enemy with your ranged weapon (if you have one) or make an attack roll with your quarterstaff if you are in melee range. If the enemy is behind an obstacle, you can attempt to position yourself so that you can attack them without giving them cover. If the enemy is within 5 feet of a barrier or obstacle, you can use your action to make a chance to Shove the enemy away from the obstacle and into an advantageous position for you to attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the goal is to regain some health, position yourself advantageously, and attack the enemy to defeat them. Good luck!\n",

      "Explanation: Since I am currently prone, I will first use a reaction to stand up. This allows me to move and attack without the disadvantage from being prone. After standing up, I will move 5ft closer to the enemy, positioning myself for a more advantageous attack. Finally, I will use one of my remaining level 1 spell slots to cast a spell for my attack. I have three level 1 spell slots available, so I can choose from Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Thunderwave, Guidance, or Bless. I will likely choose Thunderwave to try and knock the enemy prone, giving me an advantage in our next round of combat. If the enemy is able to dodge my Thunderwave, I will then use my action to cast Cure Wounds on myself to ensure I maintain my health throughout the combat. If the enemy is still standing after my spells, I will use my bonus action to cast Guidance on myself before attacking with my ranged weapon again.\n",
