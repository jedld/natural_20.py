kind: Skeleton
description: |
  Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs
  and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of
  necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.
