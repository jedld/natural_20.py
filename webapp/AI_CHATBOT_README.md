## Usage Guide

### Basic Interaction

1. **Ask about the current situation**:
   ```
   "What's happening on the map right now?"
   "Who are the player characters and what are their stats?"
   "Are there any NPCs nearby?"
   ```

2. **Get tactical information**:
   ```
   "What's the current battle status?"
   "What actions can [character name] take?"
   "What's the terrain like at position (5, 3)?"
   ```

3. **Request game assistance**:
   ```
   "Help me understand the rules for grappling"
   "What spells would be effective against these enemies?"
   "Suggest some tactical options for the current situation"
   ```

### Advanced RAG Queries

The AI can access detailed game information through its RAG system:

#### Entity Information
```
"Tell me about [character name]'s current status"
"What items does [character name] have?"
"What are [character name]'s ability scores?"
```

#### Map and Terrain
```
"What's the terrain like around the party?"
"Are there any difficult terrain areas on the map?"
"What's the lighting condition at position (10, 15)?"
```

#### Combat Assistance
```
"Who's turn is it in the battle?"
"What actions can the current player take?"
"What's the initiative order?"
```

#### Strategic Advice
```
"What would be a good tactical approach for this situation?"
"Which enemies should we prioritize?"
"What spells would be most effective here?"
```

### Function Calling Examples

The AI can suggest using specific functions to get information:

- **Map Analysis**: "Let me check the current map layout and terrain features"
- **Entity Status**: "I'll look up the current status of all entities on the map"
- **Battle Assessment**: "Let me get the current battle status and turn order"
- **Action Planning**: "I'll check what actions are available for the current character"

## API Endpoints

### Core AI Endpoints
- `POST /ai/initialize`: Initialize AI provider
- `POST /ai/chat`: Send message and get response
- `GET /ai/context`: Get current game context
- `POST /ai/clear-history`: Clear conversation history
- `GET /ai/history`: Get conversation history

### RAG-Specific Endpoints
- `GET /ai/entity-details?entity_name=<name>`: Get detailed entity information
- `GET /ai/terrain-info?x=<x>&y=<y>`: Get terrain information for coordinates
- `GET /ai/available-actions?entity_name=<name>`: Get available actions for entity
- `GET /ai/ollama/models`: Get available Ollama models
- `POST /ai/set-model`: Set the current AI model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OpenAI/Anthropic API Errors
- **Invalid API Key**: Check your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait a moment and try again
- **Model Unavailable**: Try a different model or check API status

#### Ollama Connection Issues
- **Service Not Running**: Start Ollama with `ollama serve`
- **Model Not Found**: Pull the model with `ollama pull <model-name>`
- **Connection Refused**: Check if Ollama is running on the correct port (11434)

#### General Issues
- **No Response**: Check browser console for errors
- **Context Not Loading**: Ensure you're logged in as a DM
- **Function Errors**: Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking the browser console and server logs:

```python
# Server-side logging
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Local Ollama
- Use smaller models for faster responses
- Ensure sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)
- Consider using GPU acceleration if available

#### For Cloud Providers
- Use appropriate model sizes for your needs
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Consider caching frequently requested information

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- **DM Access**: AI features are restricted to DM users only
- **Data Privacy**: Local Ollama keeps all data on your machine
- **Session Management**: AI conversations are tied to user sessions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Voice Integration**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **Image Analysis**: Analyze map images and character tokens
- **Advanced Function Calling**: Direct VTT control through AI
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support for different languages
- **Custom Prompts**: User-defined system prompts
- **Action Execution**: AI can directly execute game actions

### Integration Possibilities
- **Discord Bot**: Extend AI to Discord servers
- **Mobile App**: AI assistant for mobile devices
- **Voice Assistants**: Integration with Alexa/Google Assistant
- **Streaming**: AI commentary for live streams
